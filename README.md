# DesignAlgorithms
Homework Solutions for Design Algorithm Course as Computer Science B.Sc. Student at Department of Mathematical Sciences, Sharif University of Technology.

Spring 2023

Supervisor: Dr. Shahram Khazaei


## Description
This repository includes my homework and projects around Algorithms and Data structures.

## Table of Coding Problems
Each problem has a PDF file describing the problem in Persian in the format of a story.
Algorithms are supposed to be fast and efficient to accept the original problem restrictions.

| Problem | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [BalancedParanthesisMinimumSwapsCounter](./BalancedParanthesisMinimumSwapsCounter) | Finding minimum swaps needed to balance an input string of parentheses |
| [ClosestPointsFinder](./ClosestPointsFinder) |Finding closest points on a 2d plane with different data structures in O(n log n) |
| [DiversityCoefficientFinding](./DiversityCoefficientFinding) | Calculating Diversity Coefficient among a group of singers in a singing competition |
| [FarthestNodeFinder](./FarthestNodeFinder) | Finding the farthest node from the given starting node using Dijkstra |
| [LongestCommonIncreasingSubsequence](./LongestCommonIncreasingSubsequence) | Finding Longest Common Increasing Subsequence between two strings using Dynamic Programming |
| [MaximumVerticalMarginClassifier](./MaximumVerticalMarginClassifier) | a simple sudo SVM Classifier which only considers vertical distance (solved by LP) |
| [RookPlacingwithinAllowedArea](./RookPlacingwithinAllowedArea) | Placing Rooks in an N*N chess board in which each rook is allowed to place only in a specified area without threatening other rooks |
| [SafeMST](./SafeMST) | indicates that a list of edges are all part of the MST of the given graph using some sudo-kruskal algorithm |
| [SafePathFinder](./SafePathFinder) | indicates that there is a safe path between the start and end point in a graph which has some unsafe edges |
| [ShortestPathesToGraphBuilder](./ShortestPathesToGraphBuilder) | Given a list of shortest path lengths between vertices and trying to make the smallest graph with these properties  |
| [TreeSplittingCounter](./TreeSplittingCounter) | Given a tree, trying to count all combinations of splitting this tree with some restrictions  |

## Theoretical Problems
There is some theoretical homework along with my solutions around the algorithm topics. (my answers may be incorrect!)
sourcebook of the course:


Algorithms

Book by Christos Papadimitriou, Sanjoy Dasgupta, and Umesh Vazirani

The problems are in Persian but my answers are in English.
